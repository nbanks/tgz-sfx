This is a tar/gzip self-extraction utility for DOS written by Nathan Banks.

It was written using the Netwide Assembler (nasm) version 0.97 for DOS.  It
is also, unfortuantely, fairly picky about what version of tar may be used,
and I haven't had the inclination to improve its compatibility.  It was 
designed around tar version 1.12, and gzip version 1.2.4, both of which 
were compiled for DOS and are included with the distribution.

Usage:
  tar cvf <somefile.tar> <files-to-compress>
  gzip <somefile.tar>
  ren <somefile.taz> <somefile.tgz>
  makesfx <somefile>

The resulting self extracting archive will add 2.2K to the size of the 
executable, and will extract the archive faster than the DOS tar/gzip.

For Bonus Points:
This uses a DOS call to figure out what the path to the executing file is,
however some early versions of DOS don't allow an executing file to say
what it's name is.  In this case, a 13 byte file, such as noname.txt, may
be used to give the name of the file to be extracted.  This 13 bytes should
replace the last 13 bytes of the exe and precede any self-extraction
information.

Compilation:
  \path2nasm\nasm -i\path2nasm\misc\ untgz

The include should be the path to the exebin.mac file which is part of the
nasm distribution.
